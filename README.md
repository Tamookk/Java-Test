# Java Test

Learning Java pls ignore

## Getting Started

Dunno why you want to but okay.

### Prerequisites

* Java
* Computer
* Eyes

### Installing

Honestly the thing isn't done and doesn't work properly, and I assume that if you reaaaaally want to look at the thing then you know how to compile and run it.

## Author

* Me (Tumuk)

## Todo

### Single Card:

* Convert Currency
	* Everything (requires SQL/filesaving code)

* Make Purchase
  	* Say currency not in card only if card is a multicard and currency isn't in card (requires SQL/filesaving code)
  	* Make purchase even if currency not in card if basic card (requires SQL/filesaving code)

### Overall Program:

 * Ability to store card data into and out of a text file

 * Split main GUI components into separate classes/files to clean up the program.

## Acknowledgments

* My compsci professor for teaching me Java and thus making me fiddle around with it here.

## Changelog

* Added basic functionality for all things that can be done to all cards:
	* See the total value for all cards.

	* See the total spent in each country over all cards.
	* List all of the cards by either the order they were created in or the value of the card.
